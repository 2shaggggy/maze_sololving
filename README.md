# Maze Solving Algorithms in C 

## Project description

This project presents six algorithms for solving simple mazes, implemented in the C programming language. The mazes are provided in the .txt format. Three sample mazes are included in the project.

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
3. Flood Fill
4. Wall Follower
5. A*
6. Brute Force

To run a selected algorithm, uncomment the corresponding section in the code.
